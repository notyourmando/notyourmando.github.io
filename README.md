# WDI Project: Game

## Math Space Cat

### Objective:
- Send Space Cat, and his rocket ship, into space by correctly answering a set of 5 mathematical equations.<br><br>
- For each mathematical equation that is solved correctly, a piece of the rocket ship will be assembled on the screen.<br><br>
- Once all 5 equations have been answered correctly, the rocket ship will be fully assembled and ready for take off.<br><br>
- After the rocket ship is complete, the player will hit a "Launch" button in order to send Space Cat into deep space!<br><br>

### PseudoCode:
- Use HTML/CSS to create the space ship and the rest of the graphics on the page.<br><br>
- Create a stylized box that holds the mathematical equation.<br><br>
 - The equation will consist of two random numbers 0-10.<br><br>
 - These two random numbers will either be add/subtracted (randomly) by one another.<br><br>
 - The player will then enter their answer and submit to see if their answer is correct.<br><br>
 - If the answer is correct, a part of the space ship will be built.<br><br>
 - If the answer is incorrect, a message will be displayed asking the player to try again.<br><br>
- The Space ship will launch and the game will be over once all 5 questions have been answered correctly.
